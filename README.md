I Start Working Now: minimalistic todo list to get things done
==============================================================

## How to use

Just extract somewhere, and open the index.html in your browser. (we don't have any backend yet)

## Credits

 - Original idea come from Balint Ferenczi
 - Coding Krisztian Gergely (Krisoft)
 
Design is heavily influenced, by the nodejs site (as far as Balint can't act on it)
